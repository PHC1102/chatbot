# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds RAG functionality to your medical chatbot, allowing it to retrieve relevant information from your disease database before generating responses. This significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of medical advice.

## How It Works

### 1. **Disease Knowledge Indexing**
- The `RAGService` automatically loads your `diseases.json` file
- Each disease is split into semantic chunks (main info, symptoms, treatment, precautions)
- All chunks are indexed in ChromaDB with vector embeddings
- 124 knowledge chunks are created from your current disease database

### 2. **Query Processing**
- When a user asks a question, the system first checks if it's disease-related
- Disease-related keywords include: "b·ªánh", "tri·ªáu ch·ª©ng", "ƒëi·ªÅu tr·ªã", "melanoma", etc.
- If disease-related, the system searches the knowledge base for relevant context

### 3. **Context Enhancement**
- Relevant disease information is retrieved using semantic similarity
- The original system prompt is enhanced with retrieved context
- The LLM receives both the user query and relevant database information

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Disease Detection**
```python
disease_keywords = [
    "b·ªánh", "tri·ªáu ch·ª©ng", "ƒëi·ªÅu tr·ªã", "ch·ªØa", "thu·ªëc", "kh√°m", "b√°c sƒ©",
    "ƒëau", "ng·ª©a", "vi√™m", "nhi·ªÖm", "da", "li·ªÖu", "t·ªïn th∆∞∆°ng", "lo√©t",
    "m·ª•n", "ban", "ƒë·ªè", "s∆∞ng", "v·∫£y", "ch·∫©n ƒëo√°n", "ph√≤ng ng·ª´a",
    "disease", "symptom", "treatment", "doctor", "medicine", "skin",
    "carcinoma", "keratosis", "melanoma", "psoriasis", "dermatitis"
]
```

### ‚úÖ **Smart Context Retrieval**
- Semantic search using ChromaDB's vector similarity
- Configurable relevance threshold (default: 0.7)
- Avoids duplicate information from the same disease

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Diagnosis**
- RAG also works for image diagnosis results
- Vision model predictions are enhanced with database context
- More accurate explanations for diagnosed conditions

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:
- `services/rag_service.py` - Core RAG functionality
- `utils/test_rag.py` - RAG testing utility
- `utils/test_integration.py` - Integration testing
- `test_app_startup.py` - App startup verification

### Modified Files:
- `services/chat_service.py` - Added RAG integration
- `services/diagnosis_service.py` - Enhanced diagnosis with RAG
- `services/__init__.py` - Added RAGService export
- `requirements.txt` - Added chromadb and tiktoken
- `app.py` - Updated to pass user queries to chat service

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Disease Information Query
**User:** "Melanoma c√≥ nguy hi·ªÉm kh√¥ng?"

**RAG Process:**
1. Detects disease-related query ‚úì
2. Retrieves Melanoma information from database
3. Enhances prompt with: "B·ªánh: Melanoma, ƒê·ªô nguy hi·ªÉm: Nguy Hi·ªÉm"
4. LLM provides accurate response based on database info

### Example 2: Treatment Advice
**User:** "C√°ch ƒëi·ªÅu tr·ªã psoriasis"

**RAG Process:**
1. Retrieves treatment information for Psoriasis
2. Provides specific treatment methods from database
3. Ensures consistent, accurate medical advice

## Configuration

### ChromaDB Storage
- Database stored in: `d:\Documents\chatbot\chromadb`
- Persistent storage ensures fast startup after first run
- 124 indexed chunks from your disease database

### Customizable Parameters
```python
# In RAGService class
self.max_chunk_size = 500  # Maximum tokens per chunk
n_results = 5              # Number of results to retrieve
distance_threshold = 0.7   # Relevance threshold
```

## Testing

### Run RAG Tests:
```bash
cd "d:\Documents\chatbot"
python utils\test_rag.py
```

### Run Integration Tests:
```bash
python utils\test_integration.py
```

### Test App Startup:
```bash
python test_app_startup.py
```

## Benefits

### üéØ **Improved Accuracy**
- Responses are grounded in your curated disease database
- Reduces hallucination and incorrect medical information
- Ensures consistency across conversations

### üîç **Better Context Understanding**
- Semantic search finds relevant information even with different wording
- Supports both Vietnamese and English medical terms
- Handles synonyms and related concepts

### üöÄ **Enhanced User Experience**
- More detailed and specific medical advice
- Faster response to common disease queries
- Professional-grade medical knowledge base

## Performance

- **First startup:** ~30 seconds (downloading ONNX models)
- **Subsequent startups:** ~2-3 seconds (using cached models)
- **Query response:** <1 second for context retrieval
- **Memory usage:** ~200MB additional for ChromaDB

## Future Enhancements

### üîÆ **Potential Improvements**
- Add more medical databases (symptoms, treatments, drug interactions)
- Implement user feedback to improve retrieval quality
- Add medical image descriptions to knowledge base
- Support for multiple languages in knowledge retrieval

### üìä **Analytics Integration**
- Track which knowledge chunks are most useful
- Monitor retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction
- Optimize knowledge base based on usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **ChromaDB initialization fails**
   - Check permissions for creating `chromadb` directory
   - Ensure sufficient disk space (~500MB for models)

2. **Slow first startup**
   - Normal behavior - ChromaDB downloads ONNX models
   - Subsequent startups will be much faster

3. **No context retrieved**
   - Check if query contains disease-related keywords
   - Verify `diseases.json` file is accessible
   - Confirm ChromaDB collection has data (124 chunks expected)

## Support

The RAG system is now fully integrated with your chatbot. It will automatically enhance responses for disease-related queries while maintaining normal operation for general conversations.
